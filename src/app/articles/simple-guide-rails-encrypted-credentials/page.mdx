Indeed, in Rails applications when we want to integrate third-party services we need some credentials related to those third-party services like tokens, API keys, database authentication, etc. So, in this article, I want to share about simple guide encrypted credentials in Rails.

### We need encrypted credentials, why?

Firstly, impossible if we commit some tokens or API keys directly written in the code. it makes a lot of vulnerabilities and the application will not be secure. Actually, in many cases, the credentials are put in ENV, but this is still an issue (in some standard security cases) because the ENV can be read very clearly if we are sharing the file containing the credentials. So, the best solution in this case we need encrypt the credentials and we can safely commit code without worry data leaks.

Here, is how to manage encrypted credentials in Rails.

Firstly, there is two files:

- `config/credentials.yml.enc` : contains data value
- `config/master.key` : contains a key to decrypt encrypted data on `credentials.yml.enc`

\*don’t forget to add the `master.key` in `.gititnore` if not already in there.

### How to edit the credentials?

you can edit by executing the command below:

`EDITOR="vim" rails credentials:edit` here I use vim to edit the file, and you can use another editor like visual studio code with change command inside `EDITOR="code --wait" rails` (Adding `--wait` instructs the visual studio code to wait until you close it to save and encrypt it) `credentials:edit` depends on your local path.

here, the default `credentials.yml.enc` look in YAML format.

```bash
# aws:
#   access_key_id: 123
#   secret_access_key: 345

# Used as the base secret for all MessageVerifiers in Rails, including the one protecting cookies.
secret_key_base: 3f4a08e0574770c793d695b90516174063f507a7705852b8f16661e239b0f2e0147615d9324fc9480248b282175d7e0c1594a3cac6cdc99195ee37a6cf6c7f79
```

### How to read the credentials?

```bash
production:
 DB_NAME: db_name_prod
 DB_PASSWORD: db_password_prod

development:
 DB_NAME: db_name_dev
 DB_PASSWORD: db_password_dev

test:
 DB_NAME: db_name_test
 DB_PASSWORD: db_password_test

# Used as the base secret for all MessageVerifiers in Rails, including the one protecting cookies.
secret_key_base: 3f4a08e0574770c793d695b90516174063f507a7705852b8f16661e239b0f2e0147615d9324fc9480248b282175d7e0c1594a3cac6cdc99195ee37a6cf6c7f79
```

to read the credentials I want to give an example with `rails console`

```bash
irb(main):005:0> Rails.application.credentials.config
=>
{:production=>{:DB_NAME=>"db_name_prod", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_prod"},
 :development=>{:DB_NAME=>"db_name_dev", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_dev"},
 :test=>{:DB_NAME=>"db_name_test", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_test"},
 :secret_key_base=>
  "3f4a08e0574770c793d695b90516174063f507a7705852b8f16661e239b0f2e0147615d9324fc9480248b282175d7e0c1594a3cac6cdc99195ee37a6cf6c7f79"}
irb(main):006:0> Rails.application.credentials.production
=> {:DB_NAME=>"db_name_prod", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_prod"}
irb(main):007:0> Rails.application.credentials.development
=> {:DB_NAME=>"db_name_dev", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_dev"}
irb(main):008:0> Rails.application.credentials.test
=> {:DB_NAME=>"db_name_test", :DB_PASSWORD=>"db_password_test"}

# actually you can access only with dot between the key
irb(main):010:0> Rails.application.credentials.production.DB_NAME
=> "db_name_prod"
irb(main):011:0> Rails.application.credentials.production.DB_PASSWORD
=> "db_password_prod"
irb(main):012:0>
```

but, I don’t like if when we access the encrypted credentials we must use `Rails.application.credentials` . So, I created some config in `config/application.rb` to handle multiple environments at once.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
require_relative "boot"

require "rails"
# Pick the frameworks you want:
require "active_model/railtie"
require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
require "active_storage/engine"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "action_mailbox/engine"
require "action_text/engine"
require "action_view/railtie"
require "action_cable/engine"
# require "rails/test_unit/railtie"

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module Conto
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 7.0

    # Configuration for the application, engines, and railties goes here.
    #
    # These settings can be overridden in specific environments using the files
    # in config/environments, which are processed later.
    #
    # config.time_zone = "Central Time (US & Canada)"
    # config.eager_load_paths << Rails.root.join("extras")

    # Don't generate system test files.
    config.generators.system_tests = nil

		# HERE THE CONFIG!!!
		# assign credentials to ENV
		Rails.application.credentials[Rails.env.to_sym].map do |key, value|
      ENV[key.to_s] = value.to_s
    end
  end
end
```

you can just add in code like this

```ruby
Rails.application.credentials[Rails.env.to_sym].map do |key, value|
   ENV[key.to_s] = value.to_s
end
```

So, every you move to another environment you just only call `ENV['KEY']` this makes it more seamless 😄

```ruby
❯ RAILS_ENV=development rails console
Loading development environment (Rails 7.0.4.3)
irb(main):001:0> ENV['DB_NAME']
=> "db_name_dev"
irb(main):002:0> ENV['DB_PASSWORD']
=> "db_password_dev"

❯ RAILS_ENV=test rails console
Loading test environment (Rails 7.0.4.3)
irb(main):001:0> ENV['DB_NAME']
=> "db_name_test"
irb(main):002:0> ENV['DB_PASSWORD']
=> "db_password_test"

❯ RAILS_ENV=production rails console
Loading production environment (Rails 7.0.4.3)
irb(main):001:0> ENV['DB_NAME']
=> "db_name_prod"
irb(main):002:0> ENV['DB_PASSWORD']
=> "db_password_prod"
```

Actually, you can set the encrypted credentials with multiple environments with the below command and file `config/credentials/development.key` will be generated.

```bash
EDITOR="vim" rails credentials:edit --environment=development
```

you can change environment after `--environment=` but I don’t like this style. i prefer use one master encryption and assign the multiple environments at once in `config/application.rb`

See you, in another article Guys
Bye bye 👋
